# Detection
## Introduction
Design an APP (Android) that can leverage existing sensors equipped on a smart phone to track vibration statistics of a road/street while you are driving, walking or riding a bike. Data and statistics (e.g., distributions) are expected to be shown on a map and the route with appropriate visualization techniques, for example, in the form of color scale.
